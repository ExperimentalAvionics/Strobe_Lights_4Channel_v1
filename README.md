# 4-Channel strobe lights controller.

The hardware uses voltage booster in order to utilise 8 serially connected LEDs on each channel.
Voltage booster contains current limiting circuit, so no extra circuits required on LED.
LED should be wired with two wired. Ground (aircraft body) cannot be used for powering the LEDs.
Controller works in such way that only one channel is energised at any point of time.
Flashing pattern can be easily adjusted.
